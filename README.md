# rust_calculator
Calculator in Rust without functions

*Forked from https://gist.github.com/mlabbe/1f828a3068a398c28e651e51336a9be0
There are only 4 operators(+. -. *. /) in this forked project.

I added other operators on top of this project. 
I've converted the float datatypes to work but there are still bugs in addition and subtraction operations.

My goal is to develop it in a way that can also do calculus.
