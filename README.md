# rust_calculator
Calculator in Rust without functions

*Forked from https://gist.github.com/mlabbe/1f828a3068a398c28e651e51336a9be0
There are only 4 operators(+. -. *. /) in this forked project.

**I added other operators on top of this project. I've converted the float datatypes to work as well in this project.
